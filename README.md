```
npm i emoji-picker-textfield --save
```

Useage:

```js
import React from 'react';
import EmojiField from 'emoji-picker-textfield';

function inputComponent(props) {
    // you need to explicitly pass 'fieldType="input"'.
    return <EmojiField name="my-input" onChange={props.onChange} fieldType="input"/>
}

function textAreaComponent(props) {
    // defaults to textarea, no need to pass fieldType
    return <EmojiField name="my-textarea" onChange={props.onChange}/>
}
```

## Note on onChange:
When you onChange function fires, it has the following params (in order):
* event | Event || null - the event triggered by the change. When triggered manually, is set to null
* value | String - the actual value of the text field
```js
onChange(e, value) { ... }
```

## Getting the emoji values
The component exposes the following functions to get the unified value manually:
`getUnicode`: Returns the field value with unicode emoji characters
`getImages`: Returns the field value with html image tags representing the emojis

To gain access to these functions, you need to store the component as a ref:
```js
<EmojiField ref={(_field) => this._field = _field}/>
```

Then, to call the function, you simply:
```js
const unicodeValue = this._field.getUnicode();
const imagesValue = this._field.getImages();
```

## Autoclosing the picker after choosing an emoji:

```js
<EmojiField autoClose={true}/>
```
